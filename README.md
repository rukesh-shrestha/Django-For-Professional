# Django-For-Professional
Hello Everyone. For the past few days I have been reading the book **Django for Professional**. I have completed reading this book. I have upload all the things that I learned from this book in this Repository. **CP6** include all the work from the beginning to the end. I have also include the book in it. 

The Link of the book is: **https://github.com/rukesh-shrestha/Django-For-Professional/blob/master/Django%20for%20Professional%20Production%20websites%20with%20Python%20%26%20Django%20by%20William%20S.%20Vincent.pdf**

I hope you will find it useful.
